zh-CN character boundaries

First character Zhongda dictionary, second is that used in ICU4J collation rules.
--------------------------
A: 阿/阿
B: 八/八
C: 擦/嚓
D: 耷/耷
E: 讹(阿)/妸 The Unicode database lists 妸 as E1 but it does not appear in either the Zhongda dictionary or the cedict dictionary.
                 The character 阿 has two pronunciations: A1 and E1, although A1 is it's primary pronunciation. When used in words
                 that start with E1, 阿 should be the first character in the E group, but there's no way to do that with single-character
                 collation rules.
